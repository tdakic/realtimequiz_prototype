Feature: Quiz with no calendar capabilites
  In order to allow work effectively
  As a teacher
  I need to be able to create realtimequiz even when I cannot edit calendar events

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | groupmode |
      | Course 1 | C1 | 0 | 1 |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email |
      | teacher1 | Teacher | 1 | teacher1@example.com |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user | course | role |
      | teacher1 | C1 | editingteacher |
    And the following "activity" exists:
      | activity | realtimequiz                  |
      | course   | C1                    |
      | idnumber | 00001                 |
      | name     | Test realtimequiz name        |
      | intro    | Test realtimequiz description |
      | section  | 1                     |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I follow "Test realtimequiz name"
    And I navigate to "Settings" in current page administration
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | id_timeopen_enabled | 1 |
      | id_timeopen_day | 1 |
      | id_timeopen_month | 1 |
      | id_timeopen_year | 2017 |
      | id_timeclose_enabled | 1 |
      | id_timeclose_day | 1 |
      | id_timeclose_month | 2 |
      | id_timeclose_year | 2017 |
    And I press "Save and return to course"
    And I am on the "Course 1" "permissions" page
    And I override the system permissions of "Teacher" role with:
      | capability | permission |
      | moodle/calendar:manageentries | Prohibit |
    And I log out

  Scenario: Editing a realtimequiz
    When I am on the "Test realtimequiz name" "mod_realtimequiz > View" page logged in as "teacher1"
    And I navigate to "Settings" in current page administration
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | id_timeopen_year | 2018 |
      | id_timeclose_year | 2018 |
    And I press "Save and return to course"
    Then I should see "Test realtimequiz name"
